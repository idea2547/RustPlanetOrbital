The main differences when not using a HashMap are:
Storage:
With HashMap: Planets are stored with their names as keys
Without HashMap: Planets are stored in a vector or as separate variables


Hash map fast lookups O(1)
Cleaner code for lookup 





Hash map better lookups but use more memory

Vector slower finding specific planets
